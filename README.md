:wave:, I'm @lrstanley, and this is my GitHub profile, where I frequently publish my open-source projects. I
hope some of them can be beneficial to you or others. If you like any projects, please give some of them
a :star:, it would be much appreciated!

- :earth_americas: Originally from Michigan, US, I am currently located in North Carolina, US.
- :rocket: I am working on many projects, primarily revolving around tools to help improve the
  experience for other developers.

  programming, technology, 3d printers, games, etc.

### :pushpin: A note on archived repositories

I have a lot of repositories that have been developed over the years, many of them are related to something I would be
working on at the time, and I have transitioned to another tool or similar, or simply there wasn't enough desire from
others to allow me to continue working on the projects/keeping it active. As such, I mark repositories as archived to
make it obvious that there is a lack of attention being put in place on that project. This **does not mean it's
abandoned forever**. If **the need to maintain it resurges** or I start working on the project again, **I will
unarchive it**.

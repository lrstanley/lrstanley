## Liam Stanley @ GitHub

Hi, I'm Liam Stanley, and this is my GitHub profile, where I frequently publish my open source projects. Hopefully some
of them can be beneficial to you, or others.

* Take a look at my **website** [https://liam.sh](https://liam.sh). I have a handful of blog posts and similar content.
There you'll find more details about me, along with papers & presentations about my projects and the work that I do.
* Want to chat with me? I run a Discord server called [Bytecord](https://liam.sh/chat) (I used to run an IRC server
called ByteIRC, however I'm less and less on IRC these days unfortunately). We talk about programming, technology,
3d printers, games, etc. [Come check it out!](https://liam.sh/chat)
* **Questions or comments?** email me at [me@liamstanley.io](mailto:me@liamstanley.io).

### A note on archived repositories
I have a lot of repositories that have been developed over the years, many of them are related to something I would be
working on at the time, and I have transitioned to another tool or similar, or simply there wasn't enough desire from
others to allow me to continue working on the projects/keeping it active. As such, I mark repositories as archived, in
order to make it obvious that there is a lack of attention being put in place on that project. This **does not mean it's
abandoned forever**. If **the need to maintain it resurges**, or I start working on the project again, **I will
unarchive it**.

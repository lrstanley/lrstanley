Hi, I'm Liam Stanley, and this is my GitHub profile where I frequently publish my open source projects. Hopefully some
of them can be beneficial to you, or others. If you like any projects, please give some of them a :star:, it would be
much appreciated!

* Take a look at my **website** [https://liam.sh](https://liam.sh). I have a handful of blog posts & other random stuff.
* Want to chat with me? I run a Discord server called [Bytecord](https://liam.sh/chat) (previously an IRC server). We talk about programming, technology,
3d printers, games, etc. [Chat with us!](https://liam.sh/chat)

### A note on archived repositories

I have a lot of repositories that have been developed over the years, many of them are related to something I would be
working on at the time, and I have transitioned to another tool or similar, or simply there wasn't enough desire from
others to allow me to continue working on the projects/keeping it active. As such, I mark repositories as archived in
order to make it obvious that there is a lack of attention being put in place on that project. This **does not mean it's
abandoned forever**. If **the need to maintain it resurges** or I start working on the project again, **I will
unarchive it**.
